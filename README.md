Features
Currency Denomination Detection

The currency denomination detection feature uses the device camera to scan and identify the denomination of currency notes. The application supports multiple currencies and can detect and announce the value of a currency note to the user.
Object Recognition

The object recognition feature uses machine learning algorithms to identify objects in the user's environment. The application can recognize a wide range of objects, including household items, food, and furniture. Once an object is identified, the application announces its name to the user.
Obstacle Detection

The obstacle detection feature uses sensors in the device to detect obstacles in the user's path. The application can detect both static and moving obstacles and can alert the user with an audible warning if an obstacle is detected.
